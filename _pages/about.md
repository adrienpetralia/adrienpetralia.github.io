I am a Research Scientist at EDF R&D, specializing in data mining and deep learning for electricity consumption time series analytics. My research focuses on representation learning with large-scale Transformer models, time series classification and regression, and Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) applications.

I completed my Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at Université Paris Cité and EDF R&D, under the supervision of Prof. [Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/).
