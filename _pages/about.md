I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Université Paris Cité and EDF R&D. 
I'm part of the [LIPADE](http://lipade.mi.parisdescartes.fr/) laboratory and the [diNo team](http://dino.mi.parisdescartes.fr/), where I'm supervised by Prof. [Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/) (Université Paris Cité) and Philippe Charpentier (EDF R&D).

My research interest focuses on time series analysis applied to electrical consumption data, i.e., Time series classification, Pattern recognition, and Representation learning applied to Appliance Detection and Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring.
