## Abstract
Optimization applications with TELEMAC are increasing due to interoperability development of the system module. 
The present work is based on a shape optimization process apply to a real problem: the optimization of the streamline trajectories in front of a pumping station intakes. 
Deflectors have been designed in the model upstream of the intakes to drive the flow as perpendicular as possible to the intake entrances. The deflector’s shape is defined based on two parameters controlling the size and the orientation respectively.
In a first step, a cost function evaluating the orientation of the streamlines was defined. 
Then, a study was carried out on these two parameters to estimate, for each deflector, which configuration minimizes the cost function based on TELEMAC-2D runs. 
Finally, a statistical emulator was used to link the input parameters with the cost function residual. Indeed, this metamodeling technique allowed a simplification of the TELEMAC-2D study, drastically reducing computational times. 
This was particularly useful to apply an optimization process on the parameters of the shapes, requiring many TELEMAC-2D study runs.
